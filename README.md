## Algorithms on Strings Programming Assignment 02: Burrows–Wheeler Transform and Suffix Arrays
### Problems
Practice implementing Burrows–Wheeler transform and suffix arrays:
* [`/src/bwt/BurrowsWheelerTransform.java`](src/bwt/BurrowsWheelerTransform.java): Problem 1, Construct the Burrows–Wheeler Transform of a String, construct the Burrows–Wheeler transform of a string;
* [`/src/bwtinverse/InverseBWT.java`](src/bwtinverse/InverseBWT.java): Problem 2, Reconstruct a String from its Burrows–Wheeler Transform, reconstructs a string from its Burrows–Wheeler transform;
* [`/src/bwmatching/BWMatching.java`](src/bwmatching/BWMatching.java): Problem 3, Implement BetterBWMatching, implements BetterBWMatching algorithm;
* [`/src/suffix_array/SuffixArray.java`](src/suffix_array/SuffixArray.java): Problem 4, Construct the Suffix Array of a String, constructs the suffix array of a string.
